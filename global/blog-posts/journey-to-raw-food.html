        <p>I am delighted to be offering Raw Food, Radiant Life education – a dream come true! In my many years as an occupational therapist, it has been heart-wrenching witnessing the tremendous suffering of people trying to manage with serious, frequently disabling and/or life-limiting illness.</p>

        <p>Over and over again, I have journeyed with them through illness and many times into death. It has been a labor of love, and, much as I have wanted to give my patients all that I could, I have very frequently felt that what I had to offer was paltry in comparison to the enormity of their challenges.</p>

        <h2>The Quest for More Effective Healing</h2>

        <p>In my desire to offer more, I have been diligently seeking new ways to help through complementary methods. That quest began with prayer, continued into studying/teaching Reiki, then massage, CranioSacral therapy, Healing Touch, Ancient Rainbow Conscious Healing, aromatherapy, guided imagery, and yoga.</p>

        <h2>My Personal Health Challenge</h2>

        <p>My own health challenges with an autoimmune disease, termed "undifferentiated connective tissue disease," diagnosed in 2000, fueled my interest in raw, vegan nutrition, and, when I began to recover, I felt impelled to teach it.</p>

        <p>I found the answer to my deep desire for more training in a Spiritual Nutrition Mastery program developed by Gabriel Cousens, MD, at the Tree of Life Rejuvenation Center.</p>

        <h2>The Transformation</h2>

        <p>Following Dr. Cousens' program, I have recovered – off all medication, lab values normal, jogging (slowly) 1-2 miles, and now with the energy to share it all with you. I no longer feel that what I have to offer is paltry; it is amazing! I long to share it with you.</p>

        <blockquote>
            "If you are dealing with an illness – autoimmune disease, cancer, heart disease, diabetes, essentially any other ailment, or if you just want to feel more alive, vibrant, and tuned in to your spiritual nature, I hope you will connect with me."
        </blockquote>
