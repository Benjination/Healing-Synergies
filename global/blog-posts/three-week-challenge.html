        <p><strong>Hi, Everyone!</strong></p>

        <p>Welcome to the Raw Food, Radiant Life 3-Week Challenge! Your participation in this class can be truly life changing! In this program, you will be learning about the amazing mind/body/spirit benefits of a raw, vegan, low-glycemic diet.</p>

        <h2>What You'll Learn</h2>

        <p>Through online videos and a recorded PowerPoint presentation, you'll learn to prepare nutritious, delicious, simple, budget-conscious, raw, vegan, low-glycemic recipes, including breakfast, lunch, and dinner fare. You will follow the diet/lifestyle for 3 weeks. You can do it and your body, mind and spirit will be so thankful that you did!</p>

        <h2>Equipment You'll Need</h2>

        <p>You will need a medium-size food processor and a high-quality blender to follow the program as outlined. A Vitamix or BlendTec would do nicely, but any high-quality blender will suffice. It is possible to do your own version of the program without a blender or food processor, but it would add another level of challenge, and you would be eating a lot of salads. A juicer is also very helpful, but not necessary.</p>

        <h2>Getting Started</h2>

        <p>To begin the program, you'll want to:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Watch the recorded PowerPoint presentation (just over an hour)</li>
            <li>View the Raw Food, Radiant Life! food preparation recording</li>
            <li>Watch the documentary "Raw for Life" on YouTube (part 1 and part 2)</li>
            <li>Download the program journal, phase chart, and recipes</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>More Than Just Diet</h2>

        <p>The program includes not only a raw, vegan, low-glycemic diet, but also exercise and relaxation methods, including centering prayer/word-focusing meditation.</p>

        <blockquote>
            "A typical pattern for me is drinking a Mocha Latte in the morning, eating a big salad at lunch, eating a couple of fruits during the day, drinking a green smoothie, and snacking on a few packaged raw, vegan foods. Easy peasy!"
        </blockquote>

        <h2>Registration Information</h2>

        <p>If you are interested and have not yet signed up, you can contact me to register. However, because I want to extend this information to as many people as possible, you are welcome to peruse this page and use the materials without officially signing up for the 3-week challenge; in that event, please consider making a donation of any amount to support me in making this available.</p>

        <p>If you would like to officially participate in the challenge, which includes the support calls, you will need to register, and I am currently offering a discounted fee of $60.</p>

        <p><strong>I am so excited that you are taking these steps to dramatically improve your health, and allowing me to be your guide! You will be so happy you did!</strong></p>

        <p><em>To our health!</em><br><strong>Suzy</strong></p>
