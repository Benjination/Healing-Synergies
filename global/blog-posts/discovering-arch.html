        <p>From the website of my wonderful teacher, Laurie Grant, who regularly experiences Unitive consciousness/Oneness with Divine Source:</p>

        <h2>What is ARCH?</h2>

        <p>Founded by Laurie Grant, who was a world-renowned Reiki Master at the time, the healing energy of ARCH is a Quantum Leap Beyond Reiki. A lot of people have heard of Reiki because it has been around for the last 100 years. In fact, Laurie was told by Spirit that Reiki was the most powerful healing energy available during that time period and she can tout the miraculous results she has experienced from Reiki.</p>

        <p>Then she discovered ARCH in 2000 and knew that the healing power that came through ARCH was way beyond any of the healing energy she experienced with Reiki. If you like Reiki or Reiki Healing Touch, or any hands on healing, and feel like there could be more, or if you are just now exploring Reiki, we invite you to explore the possibility of ARCH and the healing power it has to offer you and the world around you.</p>

        <h2>An Explanation of ARCH</h2>
        <p><em>(An excerpt from Laurie's book, Kahuna ARCH Healing, A Bridge Back to Oneness)</em></p>

        <blockquote>
            "Essentially, it is an ancient way of using Divine Source energy for healing and transformation and for guiding people back to Oneness. 'ARCH' is an acronym for 'Ancient Rainbow Conscious Healing,' specific words I received in meditation for describing the healing system I was privileged to recover."
        </blockquote>

        <p>"My own healing took place in Hawaii, and a deep soul connection with Hawaiian spirituality set the course for my work. As Ku Kahuna Lokahi says, he believes ARCH goes 'back to the time when Kahuna practiced without herbs and medicine and did unbelievable healing of great magnitude through the 'Spiritual Realm." However, although ARCH knowledge came to Laurie through Hawaiian tradition, it is not just Hawaiian spirituality. It is Universal.</p>

        <h2>The Four Components of ARCH</h2>

        <h3>Ancient</h3>
        <p>ARCH accesses centuries old shamanic healing techniques and the knowledge of the Kahuna, the shaman priests of Old Hawaii. Going back millennia, ARCH recovers wisdom that was kept alive by the Rainbow People. This knowledge originally comes from a place beyond space and time.</p>

        <h3>Rainbow</h3>
        <p>ARCH uses the full spectrum of colors in rainbow light to promote healing, and this light comes directly from the Divine Source. As a symbol, the rainbow represents the bridge that connects you to your Source. The Rainbow People were ancient beings who knew their Oneness with the Divine Source, and were the first to live the principles of ARCH.</p>

        <h3>Conscious</h3>
        <p>ARCH helps you discover the origins of illness and promotes a "conscious" approach to getting well. ARCH practitioners learn a new way of living. So much is possible when you honor your body and wake up to your divine nature. You open your heart to love, your spirit to bliss, and your body to healing.</p>

        <h3>Healing</h3>
        <p>ARCH healing not only goes to the roots of illness, it removes the energy blockages that are responsible for dis-ease. It can create dramatic and instant changes in physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual conditions. When you believe you are separate from your Source, you allow in dis-ease. ARCH creates a space where healing can occur and reconnect you to your Divine Source.</p>

        <h2>The Bridge Back to Oneness</h2>

        <blockquote>
            "ARCH offers powerful healing of the body, mind, emotions and spirit. Though it is not a religion, ARCH holds a lifesaving, life-enhancing message: You are One with the Divine Source, and therefore limitless and powerful."
        </blockquote>

        <p>The arch represents the bridge of rainbow light that you cross on your journey back to Oneness with the Divine Source. Laurie learned that the Hawaiian petroglyph of an arch symbolizes the Divine. In meditation, she discovered that in their rituals, the ancient Rainbow People used the imagery of the arched bridge to symbolize transformation.</p>
