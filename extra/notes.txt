Qigong

Qigong Sensory Treatment (QST) is an evidence-based form of touch therapy co-developed by Louisa Silva, MD. Parents are instructed in this very effective 15-minute touch therapy, which is then performed daily by the parent(s). QST is performed through the clothes, using gentle patting or tapping along acupressure lines. This gentle method assists in normalizing sensory issues, decreasing symptoms, promoting overall childhood development, and improving life outcomes. 
QST helps children with autism feel more comfortable and connected. More information, including research, at Qsti.org.

Thai Massage: 
Thai Yoga Massage
Thai Yoga Massage is an ancient practice that, as the name implies, includes elements of both massage and yoga, providing benefits of both. The method is practiced with the client fully clothed, lying on a padded floor mat. Using hands, feet, and forearms, the therapist applies pressure to the muscles and energy pathways of the body, along with gently stretching the body. This promotes deep relaxation, as well as pain relief, flexibility, and an overall sense of wellbeing.
