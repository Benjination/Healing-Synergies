        <p>I am delighted to be offering Raw Food, Radiant Life education – a dream come true! In my many years as an occupational therapist, it has been heart-wrenching witnessing the tremendous suffering of people trying to manage with serious, frequently disabling and/or life-limiting illness.</p>

        <p>Over, and over again, I have journeyed with them through illness and many times into death. It has been a labor of love, and, much as I have wanted to give my patients all that I could, I have very frequently felt that what I had to offer was paltry in comparison to the enormity of their challenges.</p>

        <h2>The Quest for More Effective Healing</h2>

        <p>In my desire to offer more, I have diligently sought and wonderfully found new ways to help through complementary methods. That quest began with prayer, continued into studying/teaching Reiki, then massage, CranioSacral therapy, Healing Touch, ARCH/Infinite Oneness energy work, aromatherapy, guided imagery, yoga, sound healing, and raw, vegan nutrition.</p>

        <h2>My Personal Health Challenge</h2>

        <p>In 2000, I was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease, termed "undifferentiated connective tissue disease," and the disease process was marked by substantial pain and inflammation. There were many times I had great difficulty even turning over in bed or rising from a chair. The joints in my hands were becoming deformed. I experienced profound fatigue.</p>

        <p>About three years prior to my diagnosis, after being trained in Reiki hands-on energy healing, I had prayed asking what to eat to allow the Reiki energy to flow most easily; information quickly came my way from numerous sources regarding a raw, vegan diet. I knew that was the answer to my prayer. However, I did not adopt the diet. I chose to convert to a lacto-ovo vegetarian diet, but I was a very unhealthy vegetarian – lots of pizza, pasta, macaroni and cheese and peanut butter sandwiches, but very few vegetables.</p>

        <p>Eventually, the pain and disability caused by the autoimmune illness outweighed the challenges of diet and lifestyle change, and my diet evolved into a raw vegan diet, with an earnest commitment in 2007, as one of my two New Year's resolutions. The other resolution was to practice more yoga, which I knew I would not do unless I had to, because of the level of pain and fatigue and because it was a major process for me to even get up from the floor. So, I enrolled in yoga teacher training because I knew it would make me go. By the end of the five months of training, I was able to teach a basic yoga class and was able to decrease my anti-inflammatory medication. At graduation, I spontaneously began to jog towards my water bottle, across the yoga room. I was astounded, because I had not jogged in years!</p>

        <p>In my many years as an occupational therapist, I had never seen anyone recover from a severe autoimmune illness, and I wanted to help people experience recovery the way I did. However, I felt that I did not know enough to teach a raw vegan lifestyle to others.</p>

        <p>I found the answer to my deep desire for more training in a master's level program, Spiritual Nutrition Mastery, developed by Gabriel Cousens, MD, at the Tree of Life Rejuvenation Center.</p>

        <h2>The Transformation</h2>

        <p>Following Dr. Cousens' program, I recovered – off all medication, now able to do whatever I want to do – hike, jog, perform deep tissue massage... and with the energy to share it all with you. I no longer feel that what I have to offer is paltry; it is amazing! I long to share it with you.</p>

        <blockquote>
            "If you are dealing with an illness – autoimmune disease, cancer, heart disease, diabetes, essentially any other ailment, or if you just want to feel more alive, vibrant, and tuned in to your spiritual nature, I hope you will connect with me."
        </blockquote>
